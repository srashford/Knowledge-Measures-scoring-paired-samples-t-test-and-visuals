# Knowledge-Measures-scoring-paired-samples-t-test-and-visuals

These scripts expand on the previously created Knowledge-Gains-Scoring scripts. In addition to scoring, they join the pre- and post-knowledge measure data, determine whether the changes are significant using paired samples t-tests, and produce data visualizations. 

The data used with these scripts is periodically downloaded from UMU, several times a year.

Structure: Each script is made for a particular training. Pre and post training answers are scored and compared.

Step 1:  Pre- and post-test answers are scored.
Step 2: For each participant, the number correct and percent correct are determined.
Step 3: The pre- and post-training data is joined and exported (inner join and full join).
Step 4:  The inner joined pre- and post-training data is compared using a paired samples t-test.
Step 5: A chart depicting pre- and post-training knowledge measures is created.
